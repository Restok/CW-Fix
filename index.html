<p class = "txt1">This website is the result of my Creative Writing portfolio project. When I walked in on the first day, I had no idea what to expect. Now that I'm nearly at the end, it's all too clear just how dramatically that I've been impacted here. I really started getting into creative writing, short stories, and poetry back in seveth grade. However, I've never really established a style at the time, and just did whatever felt meaningful and emotional. Because of this class, I was able to set aside more time than ever to do more creative writing. I suppose before, I completely underestimated the depth of this field. Only through the experience and my time here did I truly understand just how powerful and complex writing short stories can become. Now, looking back, some of my poetry contained lines that simply had no meaning. They were there for the sake of being there and filling another line. I have been able to make that problem almost non-existent from practicing my creativity in this class. My writing simply felt better, now, knowing that they came from real emotions and have real meanings behind them. My style of poetry has changed as well. Instead of focusing on the impression that the poem created, and the way that it sounds, I focused more on the emotional and impactful side of things. I've also done much more experimentation with rhymes.</p>
<p class = "txt1 txt2">Every poem that had a rhyme scheme was extremely satisfying to finish. I can finally say that I wrote my first sonnet this year. The community that I have found here is arguably one of the best that I have ever been a part of in my life. It was very encouraging and helpful to be with people with the same weird hobbies as you do. Hearing the writing of others did a lot to inspire my own as well. I probably learned most about writing when I heard the writing of others, and received feedback from the same people. It's oddly comforting to know that you're with a class that doesn't judge no matter how strange your writing turned out to be. This really improved the confidence that I have in my own writing as well, and shed some light onto where I should work towards next. In addition to that, this class was almost completely stress-free(almost), allowing a much needed relaxation from the rest of our classes. This helped my creativity to flow much better as well. Perhaps my entire brainstorm process, as well as the writing of the story itself, changed as well. I've been doing a lot more reading this year as well, not just books, but anything with a plotline, really. This class has enabled me to better notice details in a story as a writer. All in all, this class has been an extremely pleasant experience, and I'll definitely miss having an opportunity each day to write whatever I want. This class really provided the spark that I needed to further and improve my perspective and ability when it comes to writing.</p>
