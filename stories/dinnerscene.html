            <p class = "txtm">“Depressing, isn’t it?” Jack the Ripper sat down at a gleaming wooden table. He motioned for his guest to do the same, but she lies still, limp on the ground. Two silver platters are positioned in front of them next to an alluring goblet, brimming with crimson wine.
            <br>
            <br>“Depressing, isn’t it?” Jack the Ripper asked again, “the delicacy buried in a human’s life. They act so boldly, so fearlessly, yet the moment you hold a blade next to their throats...” He picked up his fork and twirled his knife skillfully around his fingers. The impermeable concrete walls around them were adamant, secluding them from the rest of the world, leaving the room dark and gloomy. Jack the Ripper glanced over at his guest, then instructed her again to take a seat, but her unmoving shadow remains idle in the dark. 
            
            <br>
            <br>  Jack sighed as he stood up from the table. His feet carried him soundlessly to where his guest laid. He produced a box of matches from his pant pockets and lit a fire. Crouching down, the illumination of the flame revealed a scene horrible enough to give the grim reaper nightmares. A figure of a female lay dead on the ground, a visible line of blood emerged from her throat. Down below, her midsection was gone, emptied. The place for what held her bone and organs was now simply a hollow case. Her eyes were dead and wide open, her expression continued to resemble a form of absolute torment and fear. Even the devils could not imagine what she had been put through. Jack the Ripper, unfaltered, wrenched her from the ground, then placed her gently on the chair. Satisfied, he returned to his seat and again picked up his utensils.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Dine to your heart’s desires,” he spoke to the dead body like a madman, “My treat.” He forked his steak and picked it up, the meat was soft, delicate, and tinted red -- a suitable selection for a king. He started to bring it closer to his mouth, but the wholeness of the steak bothered him. Irritated, he placed it back on his plate and thrashed it with his knife until a myriad of tiny threads of meat remained. Finally content, he ate the meat morsel by morsel.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Please dear, do something. I feel very rude eating alone,” Jack the Ripper spoke again to the corpse. Her head hung drearily from the neck, with every area of her body smeared with blood. He put another thread of meat into his mouth, then raised his goblet high above his head.
            <br>
            <br>“I drink to your resolute silence,” he downed half the goblet, then looked back over at his guest. Jack the Ripper was disappointed to see that she wasn’t doing the same.
            
            <br>
            <br>“You must eat something, dear. Could you at least tell me what’s on your mind?” Jack the Ripper inquired the corpse for the sixth time, but clearly, he would be getting no response for a while. He strained his eyebrows as he placed his gaze on her. She seemed so normal to him, why wasn’t she eating? Jack the Ripper wondered silently in the back of his mind, why won’t any of his guests eat? If there were no problems with the people he invite over, then the problem must lie within something else, he decided.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Would you like to get a new plate, dear? I can get you another plate.” She remained soundless and motionless on the chair.
            <br>
            <br>“Do you not like the food, dear? I serve you something else.” She remained cold and limp on the chair.
            <br>
            <br>“Is the seat uncomfortable, dear? I can get you a new chair.” She remained lifeless and stiff on the chair.
            <br>
            <br>“Would you like new utensils, dear? I can get you new utensils.” The corpse remained dead on the chair.
            <br>
            <br>“That must be it!” Jack the Ripper jumped up madly from his chair, “You need new eating utensils!” He picked up his fork and knife, then proceeded to throw it with all his might towards the body. The blade impaled into her neck, exerting enough force to make her whole body drop on loudly on the table. Her body reddened the sheets, as blood tainted everything in sight. The cold, sealed room suddenly chilled another degree.
            <br>
            <br>But Jack the Ripper merely sighed as he glanced the horrific scene.
            <br>    
            <br>“I suppose I must go out and find yet another guest to dine with.”
