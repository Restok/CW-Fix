            <p class = "txtm">	My world is a loud place. From everyone emanates the sound of their own music. This music resembles their voice, and their personality. The louder they play their music, the more the world is able to hear them. However, to hear the music of others clearly, you must dull your own. Often, the world becomes so loud that people don’t hear themselves anymore. When that happens, they give up their own music and they’re no longer heard.
                    
            <br>
            <br>	I’ve tried to find the perfect volume to display myself, but there just doesn’t seem to be one. I want to hear myself, but at the same time, I don’t want to be so loud that I become an outcast of society. Everyone has accepted that perhaps the perfect volume simply doesn’t exist.
            <br>
            <br>It’s hard to maintain the right volume all the time, and this is especially the case tomorrow. Christmas. My parents have gone out and announced that they’re inviting every relative, from all over the world. So many people I don’t know are coming over, and I don’t want to leave a bad impression by sounding too loud or too quiet. I dropped my face on my textbook. Having studied for the past two hour, my mind was ready to shut down. I closed my weary eyes and started to fall asleep.
            
            
            <br>
            <br>“Will? WILL!” I felt myself waking up, my mom was shaking me. I rubbed my eyes and lifted my head off of the table. Slowly, my vision unblurred. I found my mother’s glare aimed towards me.
            <br>
            <br>“Hmm?” I mumbled, half-asleep. 
            
            <br>
            <br>“You’re supposed to be studying! Do you know what time it is?” My mom yelled dangerously close to my ears. I turned the phone next to me on and was instantly awoken by the 4 digits flashing in the center. 
            
            <br>
            <br><em>11:56.</em>
            <br>
            <br>Six hours, six hours I had napped. This day was over, meaning that tomorrow is the only day that I have to study. Tomorrow was Christmas.
            <br>
            <br>I faced my fearsome mom again as she began to rant. 
            <br>
            <br>“You know how important that test is. And you just spent this all time sleeping? You wanna end up like your cousin? Homeless, jobless?”
            <br>
            <br>I turned up the volume of my own sound so that I could drown out her angry rant. I hated it when she yelled carelessly at me. It was just so inconsiderate of her; I worked hard and I was extremely tired. How could she be mad at me for that?
            <br>    
            <br>	“...I can’t accept another failure in this family!” My mom was finished at last, storming out and slamming the door. After her outburst, I couldn’t go back to studying. I had made my music so loud that I couldn’t concentrate at all. I ambled over to my bed and fell into yet another restful sleep.
            <br>
            <br>I woke to the chattering of countless voices seeping through my bedroom door. There were people gathering already, apparently. I threw clothes over my head and lingered at the door before walking out.
            <br>
            <br>	The house had never been so lively before. Several crowds of people were scattered all across the living room. Platters of food that I never knew we had were placed on every table.
            <br>
            <br>	“Wow! Is that you Will? Look how much you grew!” I looked up as my Aunt Sammy made her way towards me. I stood awkwardly, waiting for her.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Morning, auntie,” I greeted.
            <br>
            <br>“Aw, look at you. A few more years and you’ll grow to taller than me,” laughed Aunt Sammy. I chuckled politely in return and decided that perhaps I should retreat to my room. I turned around and sped-walk towards my door when something seem to catch everyone’s attention. 
            <br>
            <br>The room went silent as a young-looking man walked through the front door. Out of curiosity, I step away from the safety of my room and inched towards the crowd.
            <br>
            <br>“Oh my god-”             
            <br>“Is she-”
            <br>“Yup, this family’s one and only failure.”
            <br>
            <br>My cousin had come to our Christmas party.
            
            <br>
            <br>I’ve never met my cousin before, and for obvious reasons, my mother didn’t exactly have framed pictures of her lying around. It was strange seeing her for the first time. I didn’t know what I was expecting; a drunk? A drug addict? Surprisingly, she looked fairly normal, healthy, and quite young actually. She took another step into the house as everyone’s eyes followed her closely. I could hear a hundred of dull tunes coming from everyone in the crowd.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Look who decided to show up! What have you been doing all this time?” A man called from the crowd.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Oh”, replied my cousin, “I spent most of my time traveling, and I’m loving it so far. it’s really amazing how different it is around the world. The--”
            <br>
            <br>“We don’t care what you’ve seen! You’re jobless, homeless, and still unwed. You shouldn’t have come here!” Someone yelled.
            <br>
            <br>“Well, apparently every relative was invited, so I decided to drop by and see what’s up,” she retorted, cooly.
            
            <br>
            <br>“Yeah, but we don’t accept useless people as part of our family!” Another man called from the crowd.
            <br>
            <br>“DNA tests don’t lie!” She simply laughed and walked inside the house, stepping onto the carpet. As if she was a repellant, everyone immediately distanced themselves five meters away from where ever she stood. My failure cousin walked towards a platter of cookies, and examined it up and down. She sniffed it and touched it with the tip of her tongue.
            
            <br>
            <br>	“UGH! How impolite! Someone murmured in the distance.
            <br>
            <br>	Finally satisfied, she took a big bite out of the cookie and began to explore other tables. Wherever she went, people slid away from her. Yet, she doesn’t seem at all bothered by it.
            <br>
            <br>	I felt a strange feeling in my stomach seeing my failure-cousin for the first time. So, I made myself louder until I realized what the feeling was -- envy. 
            <br>
            <br>I envied her careless nature. I envied the fact that she did whatever she wanted without other people controlling her. I envied that she broke free from the chains of this society.
            <br>
            <br>	Meter by meter, I was drawn towards her. I wanted to know her secret. How is she able to feel so happy and carefree all the time, despite being jobless, homeless, and constantly insulted by her own family?
            <br>
            <br>	It was at a distance that I finally heard it. I was still nowhere near her, but still I could hear a light tune emitted from her direction. Following this sound, I walked closer and closer until I was only a few feet where she stood. It was there that I finally understood. 
    
            <br>
            <br>Emanating from her was the loudest, and the most elegant melody I have ever heard.
