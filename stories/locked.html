            <p class = "txtm">He uncovered the veil draping over a tiny drawer, searching for something, a piece of him. He didn’t remember what it was he had been looking for, all he knew was that he wanted to find it. His hands instinctively reached towards the third slide, pulling it open. The contents of the drawer was covered in old hats, books, and toys. The man took them out one by one, pausing at each, with sad nostalgia vivid in his mind. Oh how familiar they looked, but no matter how hard he tried, the could not pinpoint where and when they were from.
            <br>
            <br>A tiny stained and wrinkled picture was clipped between two trinkets. The man took it out. The face of an unfamiliar woman laid in the center. He placed his finger around the figure of the women. She was so unfamiliar, yet the sight of her made his heart dance, with glee and despair. A tinge of pain coursed through the old man.
            <br>
            <br>  “WHY!” cried the old man, “WHY HAVE MY MEMORIES LEFT ME?” He slammed his fist against the ground, turning them bright crimson. Tears dripped from his eyes, mixing with the dust on the picture. The old man took his sleeves and wiped it over and over again until they began to rip. He pushed himself up as tears threatened to fill his eyes again. The old man took his aching head in both hands and squeezed them, expecting something to happen. At long he let his muscles rest and wiped away the last tear emerging from his eyes. He took the picture carefully in his palms and stashed it aside.
            
            <br>
            <br>He had to keep going. 
            <br>
            <br>When the drawer was emptied of its contents, a tiny box emerged from hiding in the corner. The man reached for it, his heartbeat increasing. He didn’t know why that was so, but a flicker of hope lingered in the back of his mind, hoping that it would fill an empty section that had been throbbing inside him.
            <br>
            <br>The box was made of wood, splintered and worn out from years of sitting in the old drawer. It was so tiny, how could such a tiny object impact him? The man wondered.
            <br>
            <br>He tried to pry it open, but he couldn’t. His hands shifted in position and turned the box around, revealing a keypad and a lock poorly taped to the side. Four numbers abruptly popped up in his mind. Each of the four suddenly hit him, filling him with an unfamiliar tinge in the back of his eyes.
            <br>
            <br><em>2-0-1-7</em>
            <br>
            <br>With his vision suddenly blurring, he inputted the numbers. The lock clicked open as he desperately pried it apart. He knew what was in there, but he had to be sure.
            <br>
            <br>The lid flew open and hit the ground with a thud. 
            <br>
            <br>In there, was nothing but air. The box was empty. But the man didn’t shudder, didn’t flinch. Still his heart beat faster than ever. In the man’s eyes, the box was full, overflowing in fact, filling him with the life of the days past.
