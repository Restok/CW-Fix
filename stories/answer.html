            <p class = "txtm">The instant that I stepped onto the carpet of my house, I collapsed. Today was the most exhausting day that I’d had in years, and my body, was just not prepared for it. My legs were sore, and my arms ached painfully from being overworked.
            <br>
            <br>Instead of going to school like I normally did, I went on a “fun”  sport event. No one told me that we would be working our asses off doing lunges, though. I lingered on the comfortable carpet for a few more minutes, then tried to stand. I couldn’t. My muscles were in heaven and they refused to budge. So instead, I turned my body to face upwards and stared at the plain ceiling.
            <br>
            <br>A mesmerizing tune started fading into play, the sound was tranquilizing, and surprisingly peaceful. Enervated, it took me a while to realize that the tune was my ringtone. I pulled out my cell phone, and sure enough, a blue screen flashed into view: 157827-47
            <br>
            <br>I didn’t recognize the number. I never answered numbers I didn’t know. Weakly, I brought my finger up to the decline button and pushed against it. Peace again, at last. Until the sound of my ringtone again pierced through the silence. It was that same number.
            <br>
            <br>Annoyed, I hovered my fingers over the decline button. I didn’t like persistent callers, but something stopped me from ending the call. A gut feeling? The arrangement of the numbers? I read the numbers over and over again, looking for something, a pattern, a clue, anything.
            <br>
            <br>Suddenly I realized how stupidly obvious it was.

            <br>
            <br>Intriguing, I decided. Was this intentional, or just the stupid prank of a teen? It didn’t matter to me, this was the most interesting thing that happened to me in a while. I answered it.
            <br>
            <br>“Hello?” I spoke into the phone.
            <br>
            <br>“3:00PM,” a mischievous child’s voice rang through the phone. There was giggling, then all I heard was the empty ring of the dial tone. 
            <br>
            <br>Yup, just a stupid prank. Still, my curiosity got to me. Of all the things to say, why a time? I threw my watch near my eyes -- it was… 2:04PM. Nothing makes sense. Of course it wouldn’t make sense, this was just a silly phone prank after all. I closed my eyes and thought about sports, about grades, about life and death. And I thought and thought until I fell asleep.
            <br>
            <br>Given my state of exhaustion at the time, nothing should have been able to wake me up. But for some reason, I did, and I jolted up with my heart pounding against my ribcage with a dangerous speed. It was almost as if my subconscious was desperately warning me. Surprised, I pushed myself up and tried to calm down. What was happening? A dream? No, the sun was still up, I couldn’t have slept long enough for that to happen. I checked my watch again -- It was...2:59 PM? The seconds hand ticked, louder and louder until that was all I could hear.
            <br>
            <br>3:00 PM
            <br>
            <br>A thunderous bell rang so loud that I could feel it in my stomach. I stumbled in confusion and surprise. My hands pushed my head up to see what was happening. The old grandfather clock was the only thing I saw before he--
