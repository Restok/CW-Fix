            <br><b>8/25/17</b>
            <br>I’m never trusting anyone again. People always complained about me being too cynical and negative towards the world, and that I should be nicer, and listen more.
            <br>I did, and now look where it got me.
            <br>It’s funny how the smallest things in life can have an impact so dramatic. They’re like the domino pieces, and it only takes a tiny push to launch everything into chaos. I’m just a nurse, a tiny figure hiding in the similarly tiny nursery room. I care and treat babies, how could anyone hate a nice woman who takes care of babies? To be fair, I might seem a little grumpy to everyone that works with me, but I’m not. I just don’t trust people. That’s why I work with babies -- people at their pinnacle of innocence, they liked me. My co-workers, on the other hand, absolutely dreaded my presence. If it wasn’t for my charisma with babies, I would have already been fired from all the false accusations made against me.
            <br>But this time, I had found out too late, and I don't think even my baby charm can save me from termination.            
            <br>
            <br><b>8/27/17</b>
            <br>Both of the families came back for a check up, and both of them thanked me. I wanted bury myself at that moment, because the amount of guilt that I feel is enough to kill me. I can't do this, I have to tell them before it's too late. Maybe I can blame the coworker who set me up? No, that would never work, I am the one that was in charge, and I am the one that committed the act, there was no way to prove that I had been set-up. According to to guidelines of my hospital, what I did will get me terminated, while making sure I never get another job again.
            Would it be worth it? Exchanging my happiness to bring them theirs? What if it had happened to me? I would be outraged if I had found out, and I would make sure that whoever did it won't see the light of day ever again.            
            <br>I guess that's exactly why I need to tell them, even if I'm going to be on the receiving end of that rage. Hesitating will just make the consequences worse.
            <br>I have to tell them that they have the wrong child, immediately.
            <br>
            <br><b>9/1/17</b>
            <br>I couldn’t do it, there was no way.
            
            <br>The first mom had come to my office this afternoon, smiling, following her usual appointment. I had prepared paperwork that would explain and prove everything, specifically, why she had the wrong baby. She took a seat her in the couch across my desk, I took out the papers from underneath my desk. I should’ve started explain everything immediately, but for a split second, I hesitated, envisioning what her expression would be like. Then I finally mustered enough courage to start talking:
            
            <br>“Mrs. Cera,” I spoke slowly, with my voice wavering at every syllable, “there’s been a problem on our side concerning you, and your family.” She looked at me as her smile faded, obviously aware of the anxiousness in my voice. Her ears and her eyes twitched in sync, attentive and waiting for my next words. 
            <br>“During the processing of your child, we, no, I have mixed up the --” Abruptly, the door opened behind us before I could finish. I turned my head and looked, a middle-aged man stood at the door. His arms cradled an infant, fast asleep. The mom stood up quickly, obviously relieved at his presence, she rushed towards him, and kissed the baby on the forehead. She took tiny figure into her arms, then swayed her arms gently. Her face brightened, she was obviously in love that baby, not knowing that it wasn’t hers. Calmer, she sat back down, and looked at me again, with her mouth spread wide.
            <br>I just couldn’t do it.
            <br>How could I? How could I tell her that the baby she was so in love didn’t belong to her, and that her baby was somewhere with another family, also completely unaware of this? I stopped and stared at the tiny little face poking out of its mother’s arms.
            
            <br> 	“Sorry, weren’t you in the middle of telling me something?” The mom asked.
            <br>“No,” I responded, “You’re good to go.”
            <br>The family thanked me and left. I took the paperwork that I had prepared and ripped them to pieces, and chucked them into the trash can.
            <br>
            <br><b>9/3/17</b> 
            <br>I didn’t show up to work the next day, or the day after that. The hospital called thrice everyday, but I didn’t answer. Now, no matter what I choose to do, there would be nothing but trouble following me.
            <br>I’ve really messed up my life, and I don’t see a way to come out of it unharmed. I’m too old, too weak, too wearied to deal with this. I’ve dug myself too deep into this mess to climb out. Maybe some other other optimist would be able to find some kind of an easy way out, but I’m just a grumpy old lady. As a result of that, there’s only one solution left that has crossed my mind.

            <br>It’s a selfish, and a cowardice solution. Finally, my coworkers succeeded, because my solution, well, it’s a unique one. It will only solve things for me. Though, it will solve everything.
