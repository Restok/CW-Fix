            <p class = "txtm">“Did you find it?” He peeked carefully behind his shoulders, then up and down the alley that mantled their presence. Everything was emptied and abandoned.
            <br>
            <br>“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” The woman reached over to the bag slung around her shoulders, with her crimson fingernails gleaming in every direction. Carelessly, she pulled out a wrinkled and faded photograph. The man reached out hungrily, but she pulled it back.
            <br>
            <br>“The money,” she snapped. She twirled her hair in front of her, covering one eye, then, leaned against the alley wall, crossing her arms impatiently.            
            <br>
            <br>“Yes, the money. About that...” Swiftly, the man produced a pistol from inside his pant pockets. He held the gun by handle and pointed it threateningly towards the woman. His hands were shaking, but still his fingers were pressed firmly against the trigger. The gun’s barrel seemed to shadow the sun as he moved closer to her. 
            <br>
            <br>“Hand me the paper, now.”
            <br>
            <br>Time stood still. A bead of sweat rolled down from his forehead down to the corner of his eye. His legs shivered as he shifted to make his stance seem more intimidating. A sliver of surprise and regret materialized in his mind as he took a better look at the women. Her eyes glinted dangerous as the corners of her mouths spread slowly into a unsettling smirk.
            <br>
            <br>“Now!” The man yelled out of fear and impatience. He squeezed the pistol tightly between both of his shaking hands. But the woman simply covered her mouth with her palm and laughed from amusement.
            <br>
            <br>Unflinching, she lunged forward, and was under his arm in a seconds. Taken by surprise, he stumbled and tried to fire, but before he could, her legs raised high in the air and slammed his hand aside. The gun skid across the floor. She put her arm against his throat and wall, and moved her face closer to his.
            <br>
            <br>“Now if you’re done playing games, kindly complete your end of the deal.” As she spoke, the menace in her tone increased more and more. He glanced at the gun in the distance, measuring his chances. 
            <br>
            <br>The man grit his teeth, “It’s in my right pocket.” She smiled and let him go.
            <br>
            <br>Reluctantly, he handed her a large wad of cash, rolled into a ball. She looked at it, and placed it in her bag. Satisfied, she handed the man the wrinkled photograph. He snatched it hungrily.
            <br>
            <br>“I never ask my client questions, but...” She looked at him, curiously analyzing his behavior, “Why the hell would you pay so much for an old photo?”            
            <br>
            <br>“It’s not a photograph,” he smiled, his eyes fixated on the picture. He put the paper between both of his hands and ripped it to pieces as the woman stared in surprise. And he ripped it again and again until it became tens of tiny pieces. He gathered them in his hands and reorganized them into something resembling an array of numbers and letters.
            <br>
            <br>“This, is my way home.”
