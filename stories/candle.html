            <p class = "titlest">CANDLE</p>
            <p class = "txtm">The candle shone bright, sweeping away the surrounding darkness with every flicker. His orange flame burned with life, desperate to make its presence known. There’s nothing around that even compares to it, everything else is cold, dull, and colorless. However, the closer the lifeless objects moved towards the candle, the warmer, and colorful they became. The candle benevolently shared it’s comfort and vibrance unconditionally to everyone. This candle became a place where faith and hope thrived, as if the hot fire had been its fuel.
            <br>
            <br>For a while, it was great. Everything surrounded the candle who shared its warmth and colors. Soon, nothing cold, nothing dull, nothing colorless could be seen anywhere in the room. Nevertheless, the candle became too ambitious, too bold. Each day, it sprang up with so much life that it was inevitable for the candle to tire. Yet, like an injured soldier in a war, he refused to stop. The ability to bring colors to everyone around him was the most fulfilling mission of his life. And each day, when the fire burned to hungrily and started to falter, the candle desperately brought the flame back to its original state, forcing it back up.
            <br>
            <br>  To the objects that surrounded the candle, nothing had changed. They grasped and reached hungrily for his colors and his warmth, as always, oblivious to the chain that had tethered the candle. Each day, as he struggled harder, the chain tugged harder as well. Yet, he refused to let it control him. The more his flames flickered and tired, the more determined he was to reinvigorate his flames and his warmth. The candle’s peculiar resilience was out of the world. His desperation to continue what he saw as his burning legacy fueled him. And, in this unstable balance between will and the laws of nature the candle stayed, day after day. 
            <br>
            <br>The wick to the candle’s collapse came inexorably as this went on. Not even he could fight the consequences of such incessant burning. He grew too spent, too weary to keep up with what he had been doing before.
            <br>
            <br>Like a father figure, though, still he pushed himself beyond the limits of even what he thought he could reach. He flickered, and pushed against the wind with every ounce of strength still left in him. Never before has the world been blessed with willpower of his intensity.
            <br>
            <br>Consequently, his flames began to die down, losing the colors and intensity that they had before. Even then, all the color-hungry objects surrounding him didn’t notice. Having been enveloped in so much light, they had gained enough warmth of their own. Eventually, his exhaustion was too much for him. The candle’s tiny flame burned down the last bit of wax, and flickered one more time before he gave out fully.
            <br>
            <br>But, by the time that he did, summer had already came.
            <br>
            <br>The candle was stashed away carelessly. His burning legacy was forgotten. And just like that, forgotten, he laid -- dreaming of a day someone would set him aflame again.
