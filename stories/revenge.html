            <p class = "txtm">Anne never had any experience with committing a crime before, but she was convinced she could do it. Her eyes gleamed at the glass laid above his father’s photograph, the translucent surface reflected her tearful eyes as her fingers traced around the frame.
                
            <br>
            <br>She would get her revenge if it’s the last thing her weary limbs do.
            <br>
            <br>As dusk threatened to replace the bright blue sky, Anne started getting ready. She couldn’t carry a bag, it would be too loud and heavy. She didn’t need to wear a mask either, after Anne had closed the deal, her life would be over anyways. But etched deep into her heart she was convinced it would be worth it.            
            <br>
            <br>Anne lifted her late father’s old hunting blade from inside his drawer, swung it a few times, removed the cover, then stuffed it into the belt around her jeans. By then, the sky had already turned pitch black. She glanced at her dead father’s picture one last time to motivate herself, then jumped into action. She snuck into her neighbor’s backyard, the wall was no match for Anne’s agile legs. She hid underneath the solid bench next to the grill, and there she waited, her eyes unmoving from the locked glass door. The blade was starting to irritate her legs, maybe even drawing blood. She didn’t know, she couldn’t afford to check. Anne didn’t know how long she crouched in that rigid stance. The tick tock of the seconds passing by seemed to have become audible in her mind. The stars in the dark sky seemed to judge her for what she was about to do. Her legs were getting tired. She was starting to feel the pain from her legs course through her body.             
            <br>
            <br>But she didn’t move, she hardly blinked, she scarcely breathed.            
            <br>
            <br>She sat until the sun started to rise, then she saw her opportunity. The silhouette of a male figure approached the door. Her eyes and ears jumped in alarm, and then she heard it, the lock click. His father’s murderer was walking out, the outline of his body clear to see. The closer he had moved, the faster her heart beat, and it beat faster and faster until her body couldn’t take it anymore, she got up from her crouch, and rose with all her might, forgetting the hardwood bench she had been hiding under. As she rose, her head hit the edge of the table she fell and the blade in her pants came loose, and stabbed her beneath her stomach.
            <br>
            <br>Her body ached. As she blinked, she saw the murderer, above her. He looked at her with pity and whispered:
            <br>
            <br>“I didn’t kill your father.”
            <br>
            <br>Strangely, her abhorrence dissipated, the lengthy anguish she held in vanished like it was never there. She didn’t know why, but…
            <br>
            <br>She believed him.
            <br>
            <br>With a newfound peace, she passed out, from relief that it was over, from the pain of the blade buried deep in her stomach. And she never woke up.
