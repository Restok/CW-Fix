            <br>The faint traces of scattered scars were never to find
            <br>No one could deny that these footprints weren't in vain
            <br>But the one who walked them still lays tattered beneath rain
            <br>
            <br>The moon shines bright tonight
            <br>But my eyes -- they lie
            <br>Never has ever a night
            <br>Ticked towards the right times.
            <br>Now -- there are no more ends
            <br>That I dream to find
            <br>
            <br>So find me --
            <br>Lying askew by the night light
            <br>So find me --
            <br>Departing with the single breath of a lie
            <br>So find me --
            <br>Following every life's ultimate bribe
            <br>
            <br>So find me --
            <br>Find me when the teardrops have dried.
